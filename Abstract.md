# Abstract:

In this document, we propose a hybrid deep learning model called DEA-RNN to address the increasing prevalence of cyberbullying on social media platforms, specifically focusing on Twitter. With the widespread use of social media across various age groups, it is crucial to make these platforms safer by effectively detecting and combating cyberbullying incidents.The DEA-RNN model we present combines Elman-type Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with an optimised Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA). The DEA is utilised to fine-tune the parameters of the Elman RNN, thereby enhancing its performance and reducing training time.To evaluate the effectiveness of DEA-RNN, we conducted thorough experiments using a dataset consisting of 10,000 tweets. We compared its performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms including Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), RNN, SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and Random Forests (RF).Our experimental results demonstrate that DEA-RNN consistently outperforms the considered existing approaches in detecting cyberbullying on the Twitter platform. It exhibits superior performance across all evaluated scenarios. Notably, in scenario 3, DEA-RNN achieved an average accuracy of 90.45%, precision of 89.52%, recall of 88.98%, F1-score of 89.25%, and specificity of 90.94%.Overall, our findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DEA-RNN model in detecting cyberbullying on Twitter. By leveraging the combined power of Elman RNN and the optimised DEA, we can significantly improve the safety and well-being of users on social media platforms.
