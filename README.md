# Defending the Digital Playground: DEA RNN's Quest to Eradicate Cyberbullying

- DEA-RNN is a hybrid deep learning model that is helpful to address the increasing prevalence of cyberbullying on social media platforms, specifically focusing on Twitter. 
With the widespread use of social media across various age groups, it is crucial to make these platforms safer by effectively detecting and combating cyberbullying incidents.
The DEA-RNN model we present combines Elman-type Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with an optimised Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA).

## Features

- DEA RNN, which stands for Deep Embedding Attention Recurrent Neural Network, is a cutting-edge approach in the detection of cyberbullying texts in social media. 
It combines the power of deep learning and natural language processing to identify and classify abusive or harmful content with exceptional accuracy. 
By leveraging its deep embedding capabilities, DEA RNN can effectively capture the intricate nuances and contextual information within texts, allowing it to discern between harmless interactions and instances of cyberbullying. 
The attention mechanism within the model enables it to focus on the most significant parts of the text, effectively highlighting the key indicators of cyberbullying. 
Through its advanced algorithms and extensive training, DEA RNN serves as a digital sentinel, tirelessly scanning through vast amounts of social media data to protect users from the detrimental effects of online harassment. With its ability to quickly and accurately identify cyberbullying texts, DEA RNN plays a crucial role in fostering safer online spaces and empowering individuals to combat the pervasive issue of cyberbullying.

# Usage

  ## Clone the repository:

  - git clone https://github.com/priyanandini1507/Detection-of-cyber-bullying-tweets-in-twitter-by-DEA-RNN-approach/new/main

  ## Install the required dependencies:

  - pip install -r requirements.txt

  ## Prepare your dataset:

  - Ensure your dataset is properly formatted for detecting whether the text is bullying one or not, with labeled examples.Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Place the data files in the appropriate directories (e.g., data/train.csv, data/test.csv).

  ## Configure the model:

  - Adjust the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, in the config.py file.

  ## Train the model:

  - python train.py

  ## Evaluate the model:

  - python evaluate.py

# Results:

 - Detects whether the tweet or text entered is bullying text or not.
